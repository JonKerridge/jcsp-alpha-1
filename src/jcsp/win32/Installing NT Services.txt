Installing NT Services
========================


If you have the resource kit (or windows XP) installed it is recommended that you use the SC command to
install the service. In the absence of this, there is an executable file called SVCCTRL which can
install and/or remove NT services.

The org.win32.dll file should be copied to the WINNT\System32 folder for the
Java service wrapper to work.

To install the CNS service type:

	svcctrl install "JCSP.NET:TCPIPCNSServer" "java jcsp.net.tcpip.TCPIPCNSServerNT"

If present, configuration parameters will be read from the file "JCSPNetCNSService.xml" in the
WINNT\System32 folder. A template for this file can be found in "src\com\quickstone\jcsp\net\tcpip".

To install the spawning service type:

	svcctrl install "JCSP.NET:SpawnerService" "java.jcsp.net.remote.SpawnerServiceNT"

If present, configuration parameters will be read from the file "JCSPNetSpawnerService.xml" in the
WINNT\System32 folder. A template for this file can be found in "src\com\quickstone\jcsp\net\remote".
	
To remove these type:

	svcctrl remove "JCSP.NET:TCPIPCNSServer"
	svcctrl remove "JCSP.NET:SpawnerService"
	
Note that the system CLASSPATH variable must be set appropriately for these services to start. Error
code 1053 is typical of a fault in the classpath.
